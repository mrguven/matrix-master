                  Words are very important to humans — they are a large part of how we communicate. 
                  Since the Web is a largely text-based medium designed to allow humans to communicate
                  and share information, it is useful for us to have control over the words that appear 
                  on it. HTML provides structure and meaning to our text, CSS allows us to precisely 
                  style it, and JavaScript contains a number of features for manipulating strings, 
                  creating custom welcome messages and prompts, showing the right text labels when 
                  needed, sorting terms into the desired order, and much more.Pretty much all of the
                  programs we've shown you so far in the course have involved some string manipulation.
                  This module provides a series of articles that will help you master the essentials 
                  of web forms. Web forms are a very powerful tool for interacting with users — most 
                  commonly they are used for collecting data from users, or allowing them to control 
                  a user interface. However, for historical and technical reasons it's not always 
                  obvious how to use them to their full potential. In the articles listed below, we'll 
                  cover all the essential aspects of Web forms including marking up their HTML structure, 
                  styling form controls, validating form data, and submitting data to the server.Looking to become a front-end web developer?
                  We have put together a course that includes all the essential information you need to work 
                  towards your goal.Get started Prerequisites 
                  Before starting this module, you should at least work through our Introduction to HTML.
                  At this point you should find the Introductory guides easy to understand, and also be
                    able to make use of our Basic native form controls guide.           
                  Mastering forms however requires more than just HTML knowledge — you also need to 
                  learn some specific techniques to style form controls, and some scripting knowledge 
                  is required to handle things like validation and creating custom form controls. 
                  Therefore, before you look at the other sections listed below we'd recommend that 
                  you go away and learn some CSS and JavaScript first.            
                  The above text is a good indicator as to why we've put web forms into its own 
                  standalone module, rather than trying to mix bits of it into the HTML, CSS, and 
                  JavaScript topic areas — form elements are more complex than most other HTML elements,
                  and they also require a close marriage of related CSS and JavaScript techniques to get the most out of them.
